                <h1>Air Jordan </h1>
                <h3>Michael Jordan</h3>
                <p>
                    As Michael Jordan entered his rookie 
                    year in 1984, he was approached to sign 
                    a shoe deal with Adidas, Converse, and 
                    Nike. In their meeting with Jordan, Nike 
                    centered its presentation around a 
                    highlight video of Jordan's various slam 
                    dunks, scored to "Jump (For My Love)" 
                    by the Pointer Sisters. Nike showcased 
                    the first design of the shoe, but 
                    Jordan criticized its colorway. While 
                    other companies saw Jordan as a figure 
                    for promoting preexisting shoe lines, 
                    Nike took Jordan's criticism into 
                    account to make him "a stand alone 
                    star and give him a signature shoe 
                    line."[6]
                </p>
                <p>
                    On October 26, 1984, Michael Jordan 
                    signed a five-year, US$2.5 million deal 
                    with Nike, three times more than any 
                    other deal in the National Basketball 
                    Association (NBA) at the time. Nike 
                    released the Air Jordan sneaker line 
                    in April 1985 with the goal of making 
                    $3 million in the first three years.
                    Sales greatly exceeded expectations, 
                    earning $126 million in one year.[7][8]

                <h3>Logo</h3>
                <p>
                    The "Jumpman" logo originated from a 
                    photo shoot Michael Jordan did for Life
                     magazine before he played for Team USA 
                     in the 1984 Summer Olympics, 
                     photographed by Jacobus Rentmeester. 
                     This photo shoot was taken before 
                     Jordan signed with Nike and depicted 
                     Jordan posing in a manner identical to 
                     the grand jeté ballet technique, while
                     wearing his Olympic jumpsuit and New 
                     Balance basketball shoes.[16] Moore,
                      who was in charge of the design team, 
                      came across this Life magazine issue 
                      and had Jordan replicate the pose for 
                      the pair of Nike shoes. The "Jumpman" 
                      logo has developed and gone through 
                      different changes and can be seen on 
                      sneakers, attire, hats, socks, and 
                      other forms of wear. It has become 
                      one of the most recognizable logos in 
                      the athletics industry.[17]
